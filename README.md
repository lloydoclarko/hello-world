# hello-world
Just another repository
Hello there, I am starting this project to learn to code for "fun" in my spare time, not for learning valuable skills that will one day find me employment (as it probably won't - either I'm not committed enough, I find another job, technology will change, etc).
But why not? What else is there to do? And what if it does happen to help my employability in the future? So,I've learnt a few basics at Uni so I'm going to recap what I know, take it from there.
